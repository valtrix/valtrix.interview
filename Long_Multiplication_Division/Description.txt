Problem
--------------------

Develop program which can carry out integer multiplication and division on arbitrarily long numbers.

--------------------
Input
--------------------

The test case will comprise of an input file which contains two <M> and <N> digit operands/numbers in separate lines. In case of integer multiplication, the first and second numbers are interpreted as multiplicand and multiplier respectively. In case of integer division, the first number is the dividend whereas the second is the divisor.

100 <= M <= 500
100 <= N <= 500

Note that the test case given in this directory is for integer multiplication operation.

--------------------
Program
--------------------

Your program has to process the input file and print the result from the integer multiplication or division of the operands.

Make sure that the program is developed in C/C++. It also should not use any STL/external libraries.
