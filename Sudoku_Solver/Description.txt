A cell contains one of the numbers 1-9 or the character 'x'. The character 'x' represents an empty cell in the input pattern.

--------------------
Program
--------------------

Your program has to process the input file and print the solved Sudoku matrix.

Make sure that the program is developed in C/C++. It also should not use any STL/external libraries.
